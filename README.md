# sailor-moon-watchface
Getting back to making things for the Pebble after a little break. A watchface I wanted to make for awhile to satisfy my inner child.

The symbol presented on the watch changes based on day. For now

<br> Sunday - Pluto
<br> Monday - Moon
<br> Tuesday - Mars
<br> Wednesday - Mercury
<br> Thursday - Jupiter
<br> Friday - Venus
<br> Saturday - Saturn
