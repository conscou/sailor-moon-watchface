# sailor-moon-watchface
Getting back to making things for the Pebble after a little break. A watchface I wanted to make for awhile to satisfy my inner child.

The symbol presented on the watch changes based on day. For now

Sunday - Pluto
Monday - Moon
Tuesday - Mars
Wednesday - Mercury
Thursday - Jupiter
Friday - Venus
Saturday - Saturn
